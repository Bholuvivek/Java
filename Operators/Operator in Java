# Operators in Java

In Java, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to manipulate data and perform various calculations. Here, we'll explore the types of operators, their definitions, symbols, and use cases.

## Types of Operators

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric values.

- **Definition:** Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- **Symbols:**
  - Addition: `+`
  - Subtraction: `-`
  - Multiplication: `*`
  - Division: `/`
  - Modulus (remainder): `%`
- **Use Case:** Used for basic mathematical calculations.

### 2. Relational Operators

Relational operators compare two values and return a boolean result.

- **Definition:** Relational operators include equality, inequality, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to.
- **Symbols:**
  - Equality: `==`
  - Inequality: `!=`
  - Greater than: `>`
  - Less than: `<`
  - Greater than or equal to: `>=`
  - Less than or equal to: `<=`
- **Use Case:** Used for making decisions based on conditions.

### 3. Logical Operators

Logical operators perform logical operations on boolean values.

- **Definition:** Logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.
- **Symbols:**
  - AND: `&&`
  - OR: `||`
  - NOT: `!`
- **Use Case:** Used for combining and negating conditions.

### 4. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to variables.

- **Definition:** Assignment operators include simple assignment (`=`) and compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).
- **Symbols:**
  - Simple Assignment: `=`
  - Compound Assignments: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
- **Use Case:** Used for assigning and modifying variable values.

### 5. Increment and Decrement Operators

Increment and decrement operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1.

- **Definition:** Increment (`++`) adds 1 to the current value, and decrement (`--`) subtracts 1.
- **Symbols:**
  - Increment: `++`
  - Decrement: `--`
- **Use Case:** Used for loops and quick value modifications.

## Usage

Understanding these operators is crucial for writing efficient and expressive Java code. They play a vital role in performing operations, making decisions, and managing variables in your programs.
